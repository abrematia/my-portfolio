    Magsaysay-Ho's work appeals to Modernism by utilizing more abstract designs and styles rather than realistic approaches. She was the only female member of the "Thirteen Moderns," a standing group of Filipino modernist artists, and in 1958 was chosen by a panel of experts as one of the six major painters of the country's history. The most famous work of Magsaysay-Ho are subject to the beauty of Filipino women dealing with everyday issues. Collections of her artwork can be found in museums around the Philippines.
